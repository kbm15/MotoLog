Blackbox, gps and safety functions for the motostudent prototype by Motostudent Unizar

In the Matlab folder you have the files generated by the GUIDE utility, and you should open it like that.

In the Arduino folder you have the files for the Arduino Mega Board.

My setup was a microsd board with SPI interface, an analog accelerometer, a gps module and a gsm module.
This allows for blackbox function and emergency call. All the analysis of the data is done through Matlab.
